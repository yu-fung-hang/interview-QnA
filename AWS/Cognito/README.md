# Cognito

## ID Token vs Access Token

**claims**: information about your user

**ID token**: contains claims about their identity, like their user name, family name, and email address

**access token**: contains claims like scope that the authenticated user can use to access third-party APIs, Amazon Cognito user self-service API operations, and the UserInfo endpoint
