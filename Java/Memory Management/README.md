# Java Memory Allocation

* memory isn¡¯t allocated to an object at declaration but only a reference is created
* memory is allocated on the heap when new() method is called

## Four sections

1. **code section**: contains bytecode;
2. **stack section**: contains methods, local variables, and reference variables;
3. **heap section**: contains Objects (may also contain reference variables);
4. **static section**: contains static variables / methods / blocks.
