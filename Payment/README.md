# Payment

## Payment gateway

Every payment gateway performs three functions:

1. Authorizes the transaction: The payment gateway checks to make sure your customer has sufficient funds in their account—and then authorizes the purchase.
2. Captures the transaction: As soon as the purchase is authorized, a hold is placed on the money. At this point, you can confidently ship goods to your customer.
3. Settlement: The payment gateway transfers funds from your customer’s bank or credit card account to your merchant account. This typically takes a couple of days.
