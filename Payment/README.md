# Payment

## Payment Gateway

Every payment gateway performs three functions:

1. Authorizes the transaction: The payment gateway checks to make sure your customer has sufficient funds in their account—and then authorizes the purchase.
2. Captures the transaction: As soon as the purchase is authorized, a hold is placed on the money. At this point, you can confidently ship goods to your customer.
3. Settlement: The payment gateway transfers funds from your customer’s bank or credit card account to your merchant account. This typically takes a couple of days.

example: Authorize.Net, CyberSource

## Payment Processor

A payment processor is the entity that actually authorizes the transactions like credit cards and debit cards for merchant acquiring banks. A payment processor is like a mediator between your business and any banks involved and can authorize transactions so that you get paid, by facilitating the transfer of funds.

example: Chase, Elavon, Global Payments
